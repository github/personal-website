/**
 * `HttpRule` defines the mapping of an RPC method to one or more HTTP
 * REST API methods. The mapping specifies how different portions of the RPC
 * request message are mapped to URL path, URL query parameters, and
 * HTTP request body. The mapping is typically specified as an
 * `google.api.http` annotation on the RPC method,
 * see "google/api/annotations.proto" for details.
 *
 * The mapping consists of a field specifying the path template and
 * method kind.  The path template can refer to fields in the request
 * message, as in the example below which describes a REST GET
 * operation on a resource collection of messages:
 *
 *
 *     service Messaging {
 *       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
 *         option (google.api.http).get = "/v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}";
 *       }
 *     }
 *     message GetMessageRequest {
 *       message SubMessage {
 *         string subfield = 1;
 *       }
 *       string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
 *       SubMessage sub = 2;    // `sub.subfield` is url-mapped
 *     }
 *     message Message {
 *       string text = 1; // content of the resource
 *     }
 *
 * The same http annotation can alternatively be expressed inside the
 * `GRPC API Configuration` YAML file.
 *
 *     http:
 *       rules:
 *         - selector: <proto_package_name>.Messaging.GetMessage
 *           get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}
 *
 * This definition enables an automatic, bidrectional mapping of HTTP
 * JSON to RPC. Example:
 *
 * HTTP | RPC
 * -----|-----
 * `GET /v1/messages/123456/foo`  | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" sub: SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))`
 *
 * In general, not only fields but also field paths can be referenced
 * from a path pattern. Fields mapped to the path pattern cannot be
 * repeated and must have a primitive (non-message) type.
 *
 * Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path
 * pattern automatically become (optional) HTTP query
 * parameters. Assume the following definition of the request message:
 *
 *
 *     service Messaging {
 *       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
 *         option (google.api.http).get = "/v1/messages/{message_id}";
 *       }
 *     }
 *     message GetMessageRequest {
 *       message SubMessage {
 *         string subfield = 1;
 *       }
 *       string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
 *       int64 revision = 2;    // becomes a parameter
 *       SubMessage sub = 3;    // `sub.subfield` becomes a parameter
 *     }
 *
 *
 * This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:
 *
 * HTTP | RPC
 * -----|-----
 * `GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))`
 *
 * Note that fields which are mapped to HTTP parameters must have a
 * primitive type or a repeated primitive type. Message types are not
 * allowed. In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be
 * repeated in the URL, as in `...?param=A&param=B`.
 *
 * For HTTP method kinds which allow a request body, the `body` field
 * specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
 * message resource collection:
 *
 *
 *     service Messaging {
 *       rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
 *         option (google.api.http) = {
 *           put: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
 *           body: "message"
 *         };
 *       }
 *     }
 *     message UpdateMessageRequest {
 *       string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
 *       Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body
 *     }
 *
 *
 * The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the
 * representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by
 * protos JSON encoding:
 *
 * HTTP | RPC
 * -----|-----
 * `PUT /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })`
 *
 * The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that
 * every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the
 * request body.  This enables the following alternative definition of
 * the update method:
 *
 *     service Messaging {
 *       rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {
 *         option (google.api.http) = {
 *           put: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
 *           body: "*"
 *         };
 *       }
 *     }
 *     message Message {
 *       string message_id = 1;
 *       string text = 2;
 *     }
 *
 *
 * The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:
 *
 * HTTP | RPC
 * -----|-----
 * `PUT /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" text: "Hi!")`
 *
 * Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to
 * have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
 * the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice of
 * defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods
 * which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.
 *
 * It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
 * the `additional_bindings` option. Example:
 *
 *     service Messaging {
 *       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
 *         option (google.api.http) = {
 *           get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
 *           additional_bindings {
 *             get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
 *           }
 *         };
 *       }
 *     }
 *     message GetMessageRequest {
 *       string message_id = 1;
 *       string user_id = 2;
 *     }
 *
 *
 * This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC
 * mappings:
 *
 * HTTP | RPC
 * -----|-----
 * `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`
 * `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id: "123456")`
 *
 * # Rules for HTTP mapping
 *
 * The rules for mapping HTTP path, query parameters, and body fields
 * to the request message are as follows:
 *
 * 1. The `body` field specifies either `*` or a field path, or is
 *    omitted. If omitted, it indicates there is no HTTP request body.
 * 2. Leaf fields (recursive expansion of nested messages in the
 *    request) can be classified into three types:
 *     (a) Matched in the URL template.
 *     (b) Covered by body (if body is `*`, everything except (a) fields;
 *         else everything under the body field)
 *     (c) All other fields.
 * 3. URL query parameters found in the HTTP request are mapped to (c) fields.
 * 4. Any body sent with an HTTP request can contain only (b) fields.
 *
 * The syntax of the path template is as follows:
 *
 *     Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
 *     Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
 *     Segment  = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
 *     Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;
 *     FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
 *     Verb     = ":" LITERAL ;
 *
 * The syntax `*` matches a single path segment. The syntax `**` matches zero
 * or more path segments, which must be the last part of the path except the
 * `Verb`. The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the path.
 *
 * The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its
 * template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable
 * matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`
 * is equivalent to `{var=*}`.
 *
 * If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `"{var}"` or
 * `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path, all characters
 * except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. Such variables show up in the
 * Discovery Document as `{var}`.
 *
 * If a variable contains one or more path segments, such as `"{var=foo/\*}"`
 * or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path, all
 * characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. Such variables
 * show up in the Discovery Document as `{+var}`.
 *
 * NOTE: While the single segment variable matches the semantics of
 * [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2
 * Simple String Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** match
 * RFC 6570 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion
 * does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead
 * to invalid URLs.
 *
 * NOTE: the field paths in variables and in the `body` must not refer to
 * repeated fields or map fields.
