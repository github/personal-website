/**
 * A `Stream` is an abstract base class that represents a bidirectional
 * streaming connection to the Firestore backend. It's built on top of gRPC C++
 * library and adds several critical features for our clients:
 *
 *   - Exponential backoff on failure (independent of the gRPC mechanism)
 *   - Authentication via CredentialsProvider
 *   - Dispatching all callbacks into the shared Firestore async queue
 *   - Closing idle streams after 60 seconds of inactivity
 *
 * Subclasses of `Stream`:
 *
 *   - Implement serialization and deserialization of protocol buffers
 *   - Notify their delegate about stream open/read/error events
 *   - Create and finish the underlying gRPC streams.
 *
 * ## Starting and Stopping
 *
 * Streams are stateful and need to be `Start`ed before messages can
 * be sent and received. A `Stream` can be started and stopped repeatedly.
 *
 * All public virtual methods exist only for the sake of tests; the methods that
 * are expected to be implemented by "normal" derived classes are pure virtual
 * and private.
