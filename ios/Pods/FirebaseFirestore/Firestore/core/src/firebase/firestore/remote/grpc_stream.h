 * `BufferedWriter` accepts serialized protos ("writes") on its queue and

 * may be in progress ("active") at any given time.
 *
 * Writes are put on the queue using `EnqueueWrite`; if no other write is
 * currently in progress, a write will be issued with the given proto
 * immediately, otherwise, the proto will be "buffered" (put on the queue in
 * this `BufferedWriter`). When a write becomes active, a `StreamWrite`
 * operation is created with the proto and immediately executed; a write is
 * active from the moment it is executed and until `DequeueNextWrite` is called
 * on the `BufferedWriter`. `DequeueNextWrite` makes the next write active, if
 * any.
 *
 * `BufferedWriter` does not store any of the operations it creates.
 *
 * This class exists to help Firestore streams adhere to the gRPC requirement
 * that only one write operation may be active at any given time.

 * The stream has to be explicitly opened (via `Start`) before it can be used.

 * can be used to send messages to the server (via `Write`); messages are queued
 * and sent out one by one. Both sent and received messages are raw bytes;
 * serialization and deserialization are left to the caller.
 *
 * The observer will be notified about the following events:
 * - stream has been started;
 * - stream has received a new message from the server;
 * - stream has been interrupted with an error. All errors are unrecoverable.
 *
 * Note that the stream will _not_ notify the observer about finish if the
 * finish was initiated by the client.
 *
 * The stream is disposable; once it finishes, it cannot be restarted.
 *
 * This class is essentially a wrapper over
 * `grpc::GenericClientAsyncReaderWriter`. See the source file for comments on
 * implementation details.
