<p>Soooo...
I was really excited for this release, mainly because a lot of people I talked to said it is a great idea and that they would use it. The problem with storing the URL into a plain text file accessible to everyone (besides f-ing security) is, that if for every user there was a text file (each just under 50B) would be a very bandwidth and storage hungry action. So I went through the hassle of doing all the PHP-MySQL crazy $(&quot;hit&quot;) and made the database. Then I went through a couple of fullscreen form and text designs on CodePen:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://codepen.io/filip_tronicek/pen/qeJjPz">When the user makes a query on a specific code</a> </p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://codepen.io/filip_tronicek/pen/rXqwro">When the user adds a URL to the database</a> </p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://codepen.io/filip_tronicek/pen/dxNdgN">Recieve link main page</a> </p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://codepen.io/MilanMilosev/pen/JdgRpB/">Main page - send link</a> </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After that I figured out that the code that is used to access the urls from the database should be 5 digit base 36 strings, so that makes about 60 466 176 combinations - and I want to make a cron script, that deletes all the codes after a week in the next major release.</p>
