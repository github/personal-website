The objective fot his write-up is to lay out some of the research questions and ideas that I'm most interested me. 

**Interesting concepts**

1. Probabilistic generative models
2. Program induction and program synthesis
3. Self-play (Active learning)
4. Goals, pland and stories
5. Sleep-wake cycle in learning
6. Transfer learning – Metaphor and analogy learning
7. Active Learning
8. Deep Learning



##### 1. Probabilistic generative models

**Underlying principle**
The process of understanding "how the world works?" can be thought as the process of coming up with a good probabilistic generative model. This model supports simulations and therefore planning.

**Key people:**
– Josh Tenembaum
– Pedro Tsividis



##### 2. Program induction and program synthesis

**Underlying principle**
The process of coming up with a (probabilistic generative) model that explains how the world works is a process similar to that of program induction. We have a bunch of observations and we have to come up with the model that best explains/describes this observations.

**Key people:**
– Armando Solar-Lezama
– Kevin Ellis



##### 3. Self-play (Active learning)

**Underlying principle**
Self-play is an essential component of the process of learning in human beings. This strategy allows the agent to come up with novel strategies unknown to its designer/creator. 

**Key people:**
– OpenAI?

**Notes:**
Elaborate on how this is an instantiation of active learning.



##### 4. Goals, plan and stories

**Underlying principle**
It seems that we don't have a static reward/cost function. We set goals and build stories that may have an implicit function that guides our learning.

**Key people:**
?



##### 5. Sleep-wake cycle in learning

**Underlying principle**
During "sleep" phase there should be a consolidation of knowledge in our agent (model) similar to what our brains do when we sleep.

**Key people:**
– Kevin Ellis

*This an eventually lead me to a good statement of purpose.*
