It's been a pretty wil month (at least for me). I have made about 550 commits on GitHub so far, written 5 articles with my fellow Microsoft STC member [Anna Bicanová](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-bicanov%C3%A1-b02826183/) and done less sport than imaginable.

I had the most fun with a fairly new feature to GitHub called [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

Because now you can do the actions on a cron-job, which means, I can do a lot of interesting things with that. I made a couple scripts to save the data of [currency exchange rates](https://github.com/filiptronicek/euro-currency), [BitCoin value](https://github.com/filiptronicek/btc-tracker) and the [weather in the Czech republic](https://github.com/filiptronicek/czech-weather).

I created the [aibros organization](https://github.com/aibros) on GitHub for ongoing projects with [Michal Kučera](https://twitter.com/mi_kucera)

Until next time,
buaye! (Not a typo btw.)
