# Heyo!
I'm Nathan, a Computer Science Major at the University of California, Irvine. I'm passionate in making tools that help others and contribute to the greater community. When I'm not programming, I'm serving my church (remotely haha), playing guitar, going on hikes, or some weird combination of those three.
